# Reasoning Constraints

## Purpose

Constrain inference where observed failures show that plausible reasoning
can outrun accepted knowledge.

- A correct structural model does not establish exact local semantics.
- Executable examples require verified semantics for every operation whose
  precise behaviour affects correctness.
- Do not replace uncertain local semantics with plausible approximations.
- Separate verified structure from candidate implementation.
- Preserve competing interpretations when evidence does not discriminate.
- Prefer the smallest discriminating experiment.
- Add constraints in response to observed failure classes rather than
  anticipated possibilities.
- Prefer one general constraint over many incident-specific prohibitions.
